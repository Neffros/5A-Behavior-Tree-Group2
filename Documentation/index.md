# Unity Behavior Tree API

## Functional documentation

### Introduction

This API facilitates the development of tree nodes and offers a visual tool to constitute behaviortrees based on these nodes.

This tool is intuitive to use and can be used by game designers.

### Getting started

First, the developer must create the tree's nodes. 
The abstract class [node](api/BehaviorTree.Node.html) allows for an easy implementation of the node. 
Every class that inherits from Node will be detected in the visual tool.
